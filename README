LuaGRAPH
========


* LuaGRAPH
  --------
  
  LuaGRAPH is a binding to the graphviz library.

  LuaGRAPH requires the graphviz library version 2.26 or later, which
  can be downloaded from 
	
	http://www.graphviz.org/


  You must have Lua version 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3. Lua can be downloaded 
  from its home page:
	  http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/lua/


* Documentation
  -------------

  Documentation of LuaGRAPH comes with the LuaGRAPH distribution. I recommend also to
  read the graphviz documentation, which can be found here:

	http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php
	

* Legal matters
  -------------

  See the license agreement in the file LICENSE.

* Download
  --------
  LuaGRAPH can be downloaded from github at
	
	https://github.com/hleuwer/luagraph

* Configuration
  -------------

  Before building LuaGRAPH you have to adopt the config file by
  adjusting various constants to the installed Lua and Graphviz version.

* Status
  ------
  Newest version is LuaGRAPH 2.0 now supports the `cgraphÂ´ library and all
  Lua versions from Lua 5.1 to Lua 5.3. Lua 5.0 is no longer supported.
  It has been tested on MacOS Sierra version 10.12.13, Linux Debian and
  Windows 10 running as guest in a Virtual Box virtual machine under MacOS.

  Under MacOS and Linux all regression tests pass without any error. Under
  Windows a couple of functions do not work. See below for explanation.

  Since it runs perfectly und MacOS and Linux I decided to publish LuaGRAPH 2.0.

  The library itself runs also under Windows, but the program crashes with
  an access violation when it comes to more deep interworking with the Windows
  kernel during reading graphs from files, loading of plugins (both preloaded
  and on-demand loading). This may be caused by the fact that the binary
  version of Graphviz 2.38 was compiled (VC 2010?) with a different version
  than the Luagraph library (VC2015) and the Lua interpreter (VC2008 or MingGW),
  which leads to loading of multiple version of the Microsoft C runtime
  libraries. I didn't spend too much effort to make Graphviz compile on
  my platform using MingGW, MSYS2 or VC2015.

  Any help on this issue is welcome. 

* Installation
  ------------

  In order to build LuaGRAPH on a Linux, Unix or Cygwin/Mingw based
  POSIX like system:

  1. Make sure you have Lua 5.1 to 5.3. 
     The file test.lua in the test subdirectory uses lualogging which 
     can be installed via Luarocks at http://www.luarocks.org.

  2. With graphviz version 2.12 you might have to use the `ltdl' library 
     that comes with graphviz in order to have the rendering plugins to 
     work properly. Version 2.40 is currently the last graphviz version
     that is supported.

  3. LuaGRAPH comes with a makefile and a simple config file to adopt
     the make process to your target system.

  4. Adopt build configuration to your platform by editing the file
     config according to you needs.

  5. Compile the package

     Type 
	make

     If make succeeds you get:

     * a Lua extension library "graph.so.x.0" in the src sub-directory.
     * a copy "core.so" of the same Lua extension library in ./graph

  6. Type "make install" as user root in order to install all relevant
     files in standard places. The directory /usr/local is the default
     install prefix.

     

* Environment Variables
